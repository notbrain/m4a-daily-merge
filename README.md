Host your own custom podcast or make your audio available to yourself with the podcast player of your choice.

1. Set up a server with audio files (M4A, AAC, etc) or host them yourself via NAT from home.
1. Create a podcast.rss file using podcast.rb. TODO: rewrite this in JS.
1. Connect to the server http://domain.com/podcast.rss with your favorite app.

Some helpful OSX utilities:

1. Audi Hijack Pro (the late model version, because it comes with real %index naming tokens)
